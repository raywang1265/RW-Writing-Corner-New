Hey there! My name is Ray and I’m a third-year undergraduate computer science student at the University of Waterloo. When I’m not busy building cool things at work or studying the theory that underpins computers and programming, I enjoy dreaming up sci-fi or fantasy worlds and crafting them into short stories (which has probably been quite evident).

My journey towards writing started upon taking a science fiction course as a fun elective in first-year, and my journey in tech started long before that—you can read more about that [here](/stories/my-story-with-tech) :)

Right now, I’m working at Shopify on a return internship and building out a cutting-edge feature to give all merchants the power to create custom Shopify apps using AI in order to help them supercharge their businesses. My favourite areas to work in so far have been applied ML and compilers, which have coincided with my recent work!
